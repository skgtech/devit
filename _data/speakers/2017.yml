      Born into an aristocratic Russian-German family, Bodil traveled widely around the
      Soviet Union as a child. Largely self-educated, she developed an interest in
      computer science during her teenage years. According to her later claims, in
      1989 she embarked on a series of world travels, visiting Europe, the Americas,
      and India. She alleged that during this period she encountered a group of
      mathematical adepts, the "Haskell Language and Library Committee," who sent
      her to Glasgow, Scotland, where they trained her to develop her powers of
      category theory. Both contemporary critics and later biographers have argued
      that some or all of these foreign visits were fictitious, and that she spent this
      period writing JavaScript.

      Μy name is Florian and I grew up in a small town in Bavaria, Germany.
      During and after my B.Sc. in Computer Networking, I started doing software development
      in Cape Town and Munich. In the time following, I did a M.Eng. in Software Engineering
      next to my job. This had also been when I started my own little company, with which I
      did e.g. build up the whole IT-infrastructure of a startup that recently got valued
      at 4.5M Euro. Right now I'm Head of IT for a startup (HiKey Resources / hikey.io), who is
      developing software for the mining industry. In addition to that, I'm a private lecturer
      on "Scalable Web-Applications in the Cloud" at a German university for a Master in Software
      Engineering. If I need to sum up my professional background in three expressions, it would be
      AWS Enthusiast, Software Lover, Process Coach.

      A really passionate dev, dabbling in engineering since my early ages. After getting both my BSc and my MSc I 
      immediately jumped into enterprise applications development, focusing on the full stack, from the back end to the 
      front end. Throughout the years my focus shifted more towards the back end but also I was one of the early adopters 
      of Android, working on it since the 1.4 days :) Somewhere during that journey I decided to read for a PhD and along 
      the same time I shifted my professional career in gaming, especially mobile gaming and been working with Unity3D 
      ever since.
