  description: <p>Open Source seems to be the way of the future for most software development, but what does the actual day to day look like for those people who are helping to shepherd projects both big and small. And why would you get involved?</p><p>In this talk, I will walk through my experiences - the ups and the downs - of being involved with a number of open source projects over the previous few years, as a maintainer, advisor and keen observer.</p><p>I will share things I've seen succeed on projects, things that cause projects to fail, and share some thoughts on what the future hold for creating sustainable open source projects might look like.</p>

  description: <p>Mobile connectivity is becoming more and more a key success factor for many IoT projects.<br>But if mobile connectivity is bound to a single network you simply won’t always have the quality of network coverage that you need.<br>Therefore, whatever mobile offers the "wherever SIM". The IoT/M2M SIM card dynamically switches to the strongest network – integrating 400+ radio networks in 160+ countries all around the world.</p><p>SIM cards and endpoints can be easily managed in real-time via the intuitive user-interface web-service or directly from the customer’s software application via an easy-to-integrate API.<br>The set of advanced security and development features for our web-service will be discussed.</p>

  description: "<p>As new features are added to the Web platform, the kind of experiences we can build become amazingly interactive and immersive--a huge leap forward from the static document based web of yore!</p><p>Nowadays we can access webcams and play 3D audio and graphics, all in real time and in the browser, but there was a missing piece: capturing and encoding! Most solutions involved either sending data to servers or porting C++ encoders to JavaScript, none of which were particularly efficient or desirable for privacy or performance reasons.</p> <p>Thankfully there is a better way: the new and shiny MediaCapture API, and in this talk you will learn all about it. Streams will be no strangers to you anymore, and you might even be tempted to cross a few of them---just for fun!</p>"

  title: Need Robust Software? Make It Fragile

  description: <p>In any software project, the goal is to create something stable.<br>We don't want it to break in front of a user. We also don't want our website to show an "internal application error" instead of a web page.<br>We want our software to work, not fail.</p><p>That's a perfectly valid and logical desire, but in order to achieve that, we have to make our software as fragile as possible. This may sound counter-intuitive, but that's the way it is.<br>The more fragile your app is in development, the more robust it is in production.</p><p>I will demonstrate, with practical Java examples, what Fail Fast means and how it helps us make software more stable.</p>

  description: <p>When I demo’ed what is now called Appium at the Selenium Conference in 2012 I had no idea what I was doing starting an open source project. I knew little about how open source operated and worked behind the scenes.<br>Thanks to the help of a great community and the advice of some seasoned open source contributors, Appium has quickly become the most popular open source mobile automation framework.<br>Along the way, mistakes were made, lessons were learned, and occasionally we got things right.<br>I’ve put together a collection of stories and lessons that I’d like to share with others to help everyone manage, contribute to, and consume open source software projects more effectively.</p>

  description: "<p>CSS is well known for being agressively global. This very behaviour makes it difficult to scale. Style isolation and dead code elimination are only two of the many problems encountered when working with CSS on large and long-lasting codebases.</p><p>That’s why a lot of clever people came up with a lot of clever ideas to make it easier to write locally-scoped, easy-to-test, composable and scalable CSS. Among these ideas, one seems to have gained a lot of traction lately: CSS Modules.</p><p>In this talk, we will see what are CSS Modules, what they intend to solve, and how to use them. I think you’ll be surprised how little difference there is between authoring CSS Modules, and preprocessor-powered stylesheets.</p>"

  description: <p>Ad networks, analytics, social buttons; these are usually third party scripts. Some of us build them, and almost all of us use them on our sites. But what are these scripts doing? How do they affect our sites and the people who use them? What’s happening with the data they collect?</p><p>As developers, we are the gatekeepers for the web. We need to understand the tools we use and their impact on the people who interact with our work.</p><p>Laura will look at what the web has become, and how we can use the Ethical Design Manifesto to make it better.</p>
