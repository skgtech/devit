  title: Integration Testing from the Trenches
  youtube_url: 1Pd2wmbPFZk
  description: "<p>When one uses Test-Driven Development, has more then 90% test coverage and the best Sonar metrics ever seen, and still finds regular bugs in his application, it is time for something more. Unit Testing is like testing a car's every nuts and bolts while Integration Testing is like leading it on a test drive: one cannot achieve high internal quality without the other.</p><p>However, Integration Testing might seem very complex when put in place for the first several times; I have made many mistakes and have lost much time. In this presentation, I will present tools that helped me tremendously in Integration Testing, as well as proven tactics to get the best out of your tests."

  title: "The future of responsive web design: web component queries"
  description: <p>Change your way of thinking about responsive web design, put your focus on components.</p><p>Web components are becoming a part of our mainstream developer toolset, and the future is all about reusing and sharing components. To take the next big step in responsive web design though, we need to make sure that these components adapt to different scenarios and different layouts.</p><p>In this talk we will see how we can combine web components with the concept of element queries and create responsive components that can adapt to their environment.</p>

  title: iOS real time content modifications using websockets
  youtube_url: JDxBGb0gR5w
  description: <p>When developing web apps, one can open FireBug and make changes to texts and images on the spot, immediately seeing the effect. When developing mobile applications, each change requires code modification, recompile and a reinstall. This makes the development cycle of mobile application longer and more tedious.</p><p>In this talk I present BetterContent, a tool that allows editing of an iOS mobile app in runtime, in a fun and easy way. I'll talk about:<br>- Motivation and need for a proper DevTools for iOS and Android application<br>- Current solutions that exist out there (such as Flipboard FLEX)<br>- Coding techniques I use on the native side (iOS, cocoapods)<br>- Websokets and how I implemented them using open source tools and free hosting on Heroku using node.js.<br></p>

  title: Your Service is not Rest
  youtube_url: n2BG8LH4OHA
  description: <p>Rest services are now everywhere. Most big companies (facebook,amazon, linke-in) offer programmatic API to external developers. However developing a REST API on your own is very hard if you don't avoid some common pitfalls. In this talk we will defind what REST is, what REST isn't and the good values of a rest API</p>

  title: Your Web Stack Would Betray You In An Instant
  youtube_url: wlkMgymRx1A
  description: <p>Securely setting up a web stack today is a tricky balancing act, as you g ingerly balance frameworks and services and tools all atop one another, ever higher, to get all mod cons happily running together safely and correctly. One security flaw though, and the whole pile tumbles down on you to throw your customer passwords to the world.</p> <p>In this talk we take a stroll down through a modern web stack and examine some recent major security breakages in each layer to see how they work and why. With any luck we can work out how to avoid this sort of thing in future too,when either using or building such tools, but if all else fails we can at least relax from all the careful balancing with a little schadenfreude.</p>

  title: Getting started with Meteor
  youtube_url: vBcinW0WSWw
  description: <p>The world of JavaScript Frameworks is constantly evolving. It seems that almost every month there is a brand new thing that will revolutionise web development. However, having a closer look you don’t really see much revolutionary stuff in those new frameworks - they are usually just a small step forward from the previous thing.</p><p>At least that’s how I felt in the past few years of doing JavaScript. Until I discovered Meteor, that is. It was enough to complete the getting started tutorial to realise that I’m dealing with a potential game-changer. First imagine that all communications happen via web sockets (way faster than REST API calls over HTTP). Then realise that you have a full blown MongoDB implementation accessible on the client side. Finally, remember that from now on you just need one programming language - JavaScript - to implement the whole application - from the client-side through to the back-end and all the way down to the database.</p><p>In this talk you will see all this goodness brought together in one great package that is called Meteor.</p>

Releasing things quickly is paramount asthere are not many repercussions - it seems.</p>y being too quick and assuming too much and he'll show how old-school quality thinking can help us deliver and be proud of what we do.

  title: JavaScript ♥ Unicode
  youtube_url: U4eQh4-atj4
  description: <p>In this talk we’ll take a look at the various ways JavaScript relies on Unicode, what the consequences are for JavaScript developers wishing to support full Unicode, and how the upcoming ECMAScript 6 (or ES 2015 as it’s being called nowadays) will improve this.</p>

  title: Live productive coder
  youtube_url: 79_HWKPrKgw
  description: <p>What makes some coders so much more productive than others? Good coders have to be lazy. The right amount of lazy. Not too lazy, where everything is copy and pasted also not to eager, where every new feature also requires brand-new implementation. In this talk, Heinz Kabutz will demonstrate some of the techniques that he uses to avoid reinventing the wheel.</p> <p>We start by looking at the IDE and show how shortcuts and a bit of automation can save us a lot of work. Smart templates produce consistent code, but even better is the use of Java 8 lambas, which we can use to define our coding idioms. We will also talk about refactoring and hear some of the interesting stories of the finance industry, where refactoring is often not an option or severely restricted.</p>

  description: <p>An XML External Entity attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts</p>

  title: GitHub Automation
  youtube_url: x4zgzJ5Igpc
  description: <p>GitHub has one of the best REST APIs you'll ever see. Pretty much any task in GitHub can be automated. Tired of updating code after a feature gets deprecated? Write a bot for that. Need to add the repository field to all your package.json files? Script it. You can even use GitHub as the backend for an entire application to take advantage of its built in collaboration features. This talk will take you through how to write you own GitHub automation code in JavaScript and give you some ideas on how to use your new-found powers for good.</p>
