  description: "<p>The age of Silicon is ending, revealing we have hit a wall. Specifically, we cannot compute. Science cannot compute the massive-scale algorithms needed to reach humanity's goals: space travel, climate control, clean power, nanodevices, and even the cure to cancer. The brilliance and emerging scale of cloud computing is overshadowing our real problem. As we continue to celebrate our baby steps, the leaps and bounds necessary are so far out of reach, most scientists ignore the reality of it. But a new age is emerging. An age of multi-dimensional, unlimited parallel-universe quantum processing.</p><p>Right out of Star Trek and the best science fiction, the quantum age is man's best hope to achieve our lofty goals. Tomorrow's software developers are today's software developers, evolved. They will enable us to reach the small and the stars. Humanity will answer questions we haven't even asked.</p><p>But to get there, classical software developers - that's you - will need to understand what's happening and why, and the amazing opportunities breathing down our necks.</p>"

  description: "<p>Let's shed some light on Node.js streams! With very practical examples we'll learn when and how to use streams in Node.js and in the Browser. At the end of this talk, you will be able to take full advantage from Streams and write elegant JavaScript applications that are much more memory efficient!</p><p>This talk has the ambition to shed some light on Node.js streams. It will provide very practical examples about when and how you should be using streams and it will progress into more in-depth stream topics. Don't worry, if you want to use Node.js streams in the browser, I'll have you covered as well! At the end of this talk you will be able to understand streams better and not fear them anymore!</p><p>In my experience with JavaScript/Node.js devs I find out that Streams is a topic still mostly unexplored and sometimes even feared. This is probably one of the most beautiful features of Node.js and it can be adopted also in the browser. Once you grasp the fundamentals, you'll be able to solve some ordinary programming challenges in a much more elegant and efficient way, so this is a very interesting topic. In this talk, I will cover the following topics: Streams: when and how; Different types of streams; Built-in and custom streams; Composability; Stream utils; Streams in the browser.</p>"
