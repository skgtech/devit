  speaker: jerry_nixon
  type: Talk
  description: "<p>The age of Silicon is ending, revealing we have hit a wall. Specifically, we cannot compute. Science cannot compute the massive-scale algorithms needed to reach humanity's goals: space travel, climate control, clean power, nanodevices, and even the cure to cancer. The brilliance and emerging scale of cloud computing is overshadowing our real problem. As we continue to celebrate our baby steps, the leaps and bounds necessary are so far out of reach, most scientists ignore the reality of it. But a new age is emerging. An age of multi-dimensional, unlimited parallel-universe quantum processing.</p><p>Right out of Star Trek and the best science fiction, the quantum age is man's best hope to achieve our lofty goals. Tomorrow's software developers are today's software developers, evolved. They will enable us to reach the small and the stars. Humanity will answer questions we haven't even asked.</p><p>But to get there, classical software developers - that's you - will need to understand what's happening and why, and the amazing opportunities breathing down our necks.</p>"

At the end of this talk, you will be able to take full advantage from Streams and write elegant JavaScript applications that are much more memory efficient!</p><p>This talk has the ambition to shed some light on Node.js streams. It will provide very practical examples about when and how you should be using streams and it will progress into more in-depth stream topics. Don't worry, if you want to use Node.js streams in the browser, I'll have you covered as well! At the end of this talk you will be able to understand streams better and not fear them anymore!</p><p>In my experience with JavaScript/Node.js devs I find out that Streams is a topic still mostly unexplored and sometimes even feared. This is probably one of the most beautiful features of Node.js and it can be adopted also in the browser. Once you grasp the fundamentals, you'll be able to solve some ordinary programming challenges in a much more elegant and efficient way, so this is a very interesting topic. In this talk, I will cover the following topics:</p><p><ul><li>Streams: when and how</li><li>Different types of streams</li><li>Built-in and custom streams</li><li>Composability</li><li>Stream utils</li><li>Streams in the browser</li></ul></p>"

  speaker: debbie_levitt
  type: Talk
  description: "<p>Software development methodologies lack the details of how UX fits into organizations, teams, and projects. Some suggest that a Product Manager describing features is enough for developers, UX should train others to do their specialized jobs, or excluding UX experts solves them being “too siloed” and “not collaborative.” This happens with no other role in software development. It’s hurting culture, efficiency, and productivity, and creating poor products for customers.</p><p>Learn how the UX process fits into Lean and Agile; augments DevOps goals; increases customer satisfaction; and saves time, money, and sanity before developers write a line of code.</p>"

Although not a new specification—they’ve been around in some form or another for years!—are we truly getting the most out of them? And do we understand them thoroughly enough to use them most effectively? Heck, do we even know what a ‘Resource Hint’ is?! Well, by the end of this talk, we’ll all be experts.</p><p>Let’s take a look at all of the different Resource Hints we have available to us, real-world examples of how best to use them, and learn about some of the more obscure intricacies and gotchas that we need to be aware of if we want to really get the best out of them (and to make sure that we really are being smarter than the browser).</p>"
