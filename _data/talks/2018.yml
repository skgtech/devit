  description: "<p>It’s been over a decade since David S. Platt ripped the lid off the software industry sausage
    factory with his blockbuster book Why Software Sucks. The industry has grown spectacularly in that time, with
    the whole mobile sector, the IoT, artificial intelligence and now quantum computing. And yet it still falls far
    short of our users’ needs, for the same reasons that it always has.</p><p>Come hear industry legend David Platt
    describe the lessons that the industry still hasn’t learned, and needs to, even more desperately today.</p>"

  description: "<p>It’s hard to be a developer and not have heard of Xamarin. It’s now part of Microsoft’s
    ‘Any developer, any platform’ strategy, and allows you to write C# and F# code that runs on iOS and
    Android. Combined with the power of the cloud, you can easily build the mobile apps of tomorrow that
    your users will love. In fact, we are so sure you are going to love Xamarin we're going to teach
    you how build an app to share photos of happy Xamarin developers. </p><p>This workshop will take you from
    0 to a fully working, cloud connected, AI powered mobile app. We'll get you setup with Visual Studio
    and the Xamarin tooling on either Windows or Mac, and connect up your iPhone or Android device to
    Xamarin Live Player ready to run an app. Once you are set up we'll cover the basics of Xamarin and
    Xamarin.Forms, then it's heads down writing a cross-platform app - using one code base for a
    fully-native app that runs on both iOS and Android.</p><p>The app we build will combine accessing device
    hardware using Xamarin plugins, AI for face and emotion detection and cloud services like authentication
    and blob storage, all built using a serverless architecture. Finally we'll go from code to production
    ready, using Visual Studio App Center to build your app, monitor for crashes, gather analytics, and
    prepare you app for distribution. We'll even look at wiring up push notifications so your app can be
    notified when someone else uploads a photo. </p><p>By the end of the day you will have a production ready,
    AI and cloud powered mobile app.</p>"

  description: "<p>PHP is undervalued in the world of web development. Yet, with the rise of PHP7,
    modern frameworks, and design principles, PHP has grown far beyond the basic scripting language it
    started as. In this presentation, we'll focus on what distinguishes a good PHP developer from a
    strong one. We'll learn how we can become better developers and make use of the SOLID design
    principles to deliver scalable and extendable solutions.</p><p> Prerequisites: good understanding of
    Object Oriented Programming and PHP; working environment with MySQL, PHP and Apache;

    use it to deliver their main applications. In this workshop, you will learn how to
    set up a serverless project, configure it, and scale it. The practical experience
    will show you how easy it is to use it and will also point out some common issues
    you may run into. You'll be able to deploy your infrastructure in minutes and
    decide if serverless is the right fit for your projects and work environment.</p>
    <p>You will need: very basic unix skills, at least general knowledge of yaml,

  description: "<p>Nowadays you shouldn't click your cloud infrastructure together anymore.
    Whether you only manage a few servers in startup or a big fleet of cloud instances, you
    need to code your cloud. In this talk I will present you Terraform to do this exact
    case and how you utilize their module system to create reusable infrastructure components.
    In the second part I'll present you how to use Terragrunt as additional tool to use Terraform
    modules over multiple environments and link your infrastructure components together."

    a notion they work better since our emotional system has a significant impact on how our
    cognitive system operates. What as designers can we do to use that fact on our behalf and
    improve user experiences?</p><p>In this workshops, I'll show how emotions impact product
    success, why is essential for product team members to know how human visual perception
    works and why details matter. I'll walk you through series of screen examples by which
    we will see how humans perceive objects and ways in which we can apply that knowledge
    for designing better user interfaces.</p><p>Please have with you one of the following
    installed together with the basic knowledge of Sketch, Adobe XD, Figma or
    InVision Studio, something for sketching and making notes, passion

    with technology. It starts with a discussion about the history of interfaces and
    human communication and follows with selected examples of how to design post-screen,
    drawing some specific cases from Virtual and Augmented Reality.</p><p>The workshop will
    be fun and interactive, so bring your imagination and use the world around you. At
    the end of the workshop, you should be able to walk away with a low fidelity

- title: "Code Reviews Gone Wild"
  speaker: lauren_robinson
  description: "<p>Making code review sessions a part of your team's
    development process has many benefits - increased code quality,
    fewer bugs and errors at production, skill improvement and greater
    knowledge exchange.Many of us have the view that a code review
    is a purely technical activity, with its main goal being to find
    faults with the person requesting the view's implementation
    of a particular solution. But a code review involves so
    much more than that. There are social and cultural implications
    to consider once you are involved in a code review that can
    be seen in the way we communicate throughout the process of
    a review. What, how and when we say things can directly
    determine the success or failure of a code review and
    prevent us from reaping the benefits that code reviews
    provide. Forgetting the non-technical side of code reviews
    can cause them to spiral out of control, giving them the
    power to even destroy relationships within teams!</p>
    <p>There are many techniques that can be used to save code
    reviews and even prevent this from happening in the first
    place. This hands-on workshop will give you practical
    tips on how to make constructive code reviews while
    avoiding common pitfalls throughout the process.</p>
    <p><b>Agenda</b><ol><li>Communication (Social stuff)</li>
    <li>The Anatomy of Code Reviews (Ooooo Anatomy…so fancy)</li>
    <li>Writing reviewable code (What code can't be reviewed?)</li>
    <li>The Code Review Process (Sigh…why does everything have to be a process?)</li>
    <li>Dealing with difficult reviews (Help! Abort! ABORT!)</li>
