    Xamarin.Forms, then it's heads down writing a cross-platform app - using one code base for a

    prepare you app for distribution. We'll even look at wiring up push notifications so your app can be
    notified when someone else uploads a photo. </p><p>By the end of the day you will have a production ready,

  description: "<p>Making code review sessions a part of your team's
    development process has many benefits - increased code quality,
    fewer bugs and errors at production, skill improvement and greater
    knowledge exchange. Many of us have the view that a code review
    is a purely technical activity, with its main goal being to find
    faults with the person requesting the view's implementation
    of a particular solution. But a code review involves so
    much more than that. There are social and cultural implications
    to consider once you are involved in a code review that can
    be seen in the way we communicate throughout the process of
    a review. What, how and when we say things can directly
    determine the success or failure of a code review and
    prevent us from reaping the benefits that code reviews
    provide. Forgetting the non-technical side of code reviews
    can cause them to spiral out of control, giving them the
    power to even destroy relationships within teams!</p>
    <p>There are many techniques that can be used to save code
    reviews and even prevent this from happening in the first
    place. This hands-on workshop will give you practical
    tips on how to make constructive code reviews while
    avoiding common pitfalls throughout the process.</p>
