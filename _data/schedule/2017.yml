    title: Data collection, forms, inclusivity
    speaker: hugo_giraudel
    description: "Asking for information online is hard. Users are cautious about the data they share. Companies are quite terrible at asking for the right piece of information, let alone phrasing it correctly. In this presentation, we’ll focus on two major pieces of information about a person: their name, and their gender. We’ll see how not to ask for them, and how we can ensure inclusivity and diversity on the web by asking the right thing in the right format."

    description: "In which we explore how some of the core ideas from modern functional programming (like managing side effects with referential transparency and managing state with persistent data structures) can be used to make modern web development less of a mess by putting them into practice writing a single page web app with real moving parts (OK, it’s a game and it has dogs) while you watch in astonishment."

    title: Build Features, Not Apps
    description: "Most iPhone users don’t bother installing any apps per months. And worse, ~80% never use an app they’ve installed again. The future of mobile is clearly not apps, but features. Features that make the iPhone ecosystem still a native experience, but as open and flexible as the web. Learn how you could prepare for that future."

    title: Learn Redis the hard way ... in production @Trivago
    speaker: andy_grunwald
    description: For our products, like the trivago hotel search, we are using Redis a lot. The use cases vary, Caching, temporary storage of data before moving those into another storage or a typical database for hotel meta data including persistence. The main parts of the hotel search are build with PHP for the frontend (web) and Java for the backend part. In this talk we will focus on the combination of our PHP app and Redis. Both are running fine, but it was a long and hard way up to the current situation. We will tell you the story how we learned to use Redis. Including our failures and experience.

    title: Deploying ElasticSearch clusters on Azure using SaltStack
    speaker: rita_zhang
    description: SaltStack is an Open Source project that aims to deliver infrastructure as code and configuration management with abstraction of the cloud provider selected. In this session, we will take a look at an end-to-end real world example of provisioning an ElasticSearch cluster on Azure using SaltStack configurations. The model of SaltStack is based on master and minions with each minion agent reaching back to the master; this makes the solution very scalable. The master holds the configuration of the minions in a set of configuration files. Those files provide an idempotent configuration that will be applied when the minion role is deployed or at any time the configuration is re-applied.

    title: "What Big Data is Missing: Remembering Our Humanity"
    speaker: marisa_morby
    description: "<p>What makes people buy something online? Is it the color of a button, the words in the headline, or eye-catching design? Big data tells us that if we get the right combination of these things, we'll see a huge uptick in sales. But what it doesn't account for is the individual. Because each person that clicks \"buy\" has a much larger story to tell.
    </p>
    What You'll Learn:<ul>
        <li>A framework for asking better questions during interviews that highlight the deeper personal motivations that influence purchasing decisions.</li>
        <li>Strategies for analyzing and finding patterns in the data that show you what people want — even if they don't realize it yet.</li>
        <li>A checklist for identifying the gaps in your marketing — and how to fill them.</li>
        <li>Techniques for interviewing customers that will get them to tell you the words they want to hear in your marketing.</li></ul>"

    title: AI on a Pi
    description: In recent months, Artificial Intelligence has become the hottest topic in the IT industry. In this session, we’ll explain how Deep Learning — a subset of AI — differs from traditional Machine Learning and how it can help you solve complex problems such as computer vision or natural language processing. We’ll introduce you to MXNet, an Open Source Deep Learning library and we’ll show you to run it on a Raspberry Pi. Then, using a camera and a pre-trained object detection model, we’ll show random objects to the Pi…and listen to what it thinks the objects are, thanks to the text-to-speech capabilities of Amazon Polly.
