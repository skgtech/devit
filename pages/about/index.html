      What is DEVit?
    </div>
    <p class="leading--dark">
      Every year we are setting the bar higher and deliver a world-class conference on web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEVit started in 2015 and it takes place every year in Thessaloniki, Greece. It is known for its top speaking talent, a mixture of world-class and world-renowned developers, highly specialized technology niches and developers who are on the edge of technology frontiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendees of the conference are mostly highly trained and motivated web developers, representing the cream of the crop in talent South East Europe has to offer. DEVit, now in its fourth year, has become the defacto meeting point of all seasoned web development professionals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether itâ€™s Frontend, UI/UX, Backend, DevOps or Mobile that you care about, join us to learn about the most modern practices and techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEVit is a non-profit conference organized by volunteers. All proceeds are used to bringing top-tier speakers and organizing advanced workshops on all trending web technologies.
